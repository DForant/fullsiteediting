# Hi, and welcome to this course about full site editing with WordPress.

My name is Carolina Nymark.

And I made this course about full site editing and block based themes,
in a time that is both exciting, andâ€¦ a little bit scary.

Right now, we are all trying to keep up with the constant changes to the Gutenberg block editor.

And it is a bittersweet challenge.

Full site editing will change how everyone uses themes, and how we build them.

The reason why I have created this course now, is that we are only six months away from a planned release of WordPress 5.6.
The version that will include full site editing.

This gives us just a little bit of time to test, learn, provide feedback, and influence change.
These steps are essential if we want full site editing to work for us.

The Gutenberg plugin is on a short release schedule.

The first version of this course, will only be an overview of what is available right now.

You will have access to all updates that are added to the course.

To make the most out of this course you need to have basic knowledge of theme development. You need to know: HTML, PHP and CSS.

-But this is not a course where you will learn how to build themes from scratch.

You will learn:

-How to create templates and template parts.
-How to combine and include template parts.
-How to create block patterns.
-And how to work with the templates in the site editor.

You will learn about the new full site editing blocks, and how to use semantic HTML and custom classes with your blocks.
